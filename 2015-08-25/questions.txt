## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
	Assuming that the time it takes to count each row is the same
	X = (time to start) + (time to compute row counts)
		+ (time for instructor to gather) + (time for indstructor to add)

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
	For n students,
	X = n x (time to count 1 student)

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
	If we set Eq1 and Eq2 equal and solve for n. We can find out for what 
	n will both methods take the same amount of time. For any number of students
	greater than n, the parallel method will take less time.

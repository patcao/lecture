Pre-Class Questions:

Consider the following naive row-based N x N matmul (matrix multiplication):

for (i = 0; i < N; i++){
   for (j = 0; j < N; j++){
      tmp = 0
      for (k = 0; k < N; k++)
         tmp += A[i,k] * B[k,j]
   }
      C[i,j] = tmp
}

Suppose data is in double-precision floating point. We are interested in
estimating the memory-based arithmetic intensity (AI) of this code. The
memory-based AI is defined that (# flops) / (# bytes transferred between memory
and cache), and depends on the cache size. Suppose the cache uses a
least-recently-used (LRU) policy for deciding which data to flush when moving
something into an already-full cache.

1. Suppose 16N is significantly larger than the size of our L3 cache. What is
the memory-based AI of this code? (Hint: What is the memory-based AI of just the
innermost loop?)
	2N flops and 16N bytes loaded into the cache
	AI = 1 / 8

2. Now suppose that the cache is substantially larger than 16N, but
substantially smaller than 8N^2. What is the AI now?
	AI = 1 / 4. Every iteration of the second outermost loop will cause data to be reloaded
	into the cache.

3. Now suppose the cache is large enough to hold all of A, B, and C. What is the
AI now? (Hint: Writing to a byte of memory not already in the cache incurs two
memory transfers: one to move the data to the cache for writing, and one to move
the written data back to main memory.)
	N^3 flops, 16N^2 bytes loaded for A and B. 16N^2 bytes written for C.
	AI = N / 32

4. Cache overflowing. On my CPU (Intel i7-4700 HQ), L1, L2, and L3 caches are 32
KB, 256 KB, and 6 MB respectively. What is the largest problem size N that will
fit in each cache? What is the arithmetic intensity associated with each problem
size?
	

5. My CPU has 4 cores, each of which can do 8 fused multiply-adds per cycle, has
a clock rate of 2.4 GHz, and a memory bandwidth of 25.6 GB/s. At what arithmetic
intensity does my machine become CPU-bound?
	Total Flops = 4 * 8 * 2.4 *10^9 = 76.8 GFlops / sec
	AI = flops / btes transferred = 76.8 * 10^9 / (25.6 * 10^9) = 3

6. So, for what size range for N will naive matmul be CPU-bound on my machine?
	Matmul will be CPU bound by N  > 96

7. So, what will a plot of Flops/sec vs N look like?
